            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And, houbeit I haue ben halfe perſwaded by diuers of my freinds, that it will be a preſent ill accepted, as well for the authors ſake who firſt compiled it in latin, as for the ſubiect of the hiſtory it ſelfe, which treateth of an action, to which moſt of you profeſſe to be enemyes in affection, and many of you did actually thew it in your perſons; yet when I reflect that you are Gentlemen and ſouldiers, and conſequently men as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in your affections, as your actions, louing worth for
<pb facs="tcp:150642:3"/>worths ſake, whereſoeuer it appeareth, I reſolued to ſtop my eares to the ſuggeſtions of my freinds, and aduenture to preſent you with this hiſtory in Engliſh, which in the Latin tongue hath gained ſo generall an applauſe. I confeſſe it is like to ſuffer, and looſe of its firſt luſtre, by putting on this vnfashioned out-landish garment, the rather, bycauſe it is fallen into the hands of a VVorkeman, whoſe profeſsion is to manage the Pike, not the pen: but when, after two yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, I perceaued no better pen would vndertake it, and that all preſſes were dayly filled with vnworthy pamphlets, whilſt this excellent hiſtory, which (as I am tould) hath trauelled Italy, France and Spaine, had not yet, nor was not like, to paſſe into our Hand, I thought it better to wrong the hiſtory, by cloathing it out of fashion, then iniury our whole nation, by keeping from them ſuch a hiſtory: and of our nation I found none fitter to patronize ſuch a ſubiect, nor ſo able to iudge of the worth of it, as your ſelues. To you therfore, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I wholy dedicate this tranſlation, wishing no other Reader, then men of your profeſsion, who are only capable of making profit of it. Other men may peraduenture read it to pick a quarrell with the Author, whom, though they cannot conuince of any falshood in his hiſtory, yet bycauſe he is a ſtranger to their nation and Religion, his phraſe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of circumſtances, will diſtaſt their pallat. Others may chance to ſtumble at the ſtile of the tranſlatour, bycauſe it is rough, and not ſo pollished as a pen-man might haue made it, not reflecting that he is to tye him ſelfe to the conceit and phraſe of the Author. Others againe may blame the petty faults in printing, without conſideration that it was printed by a ſtranger. But you, whoſe thoughts are fixed vppon honorable obiects, and profeſſe to admire great actions, euen in your greateſt aduerſaryes, ſoare higher then to meet with any of theſe obſtacles, which take the eyes of shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Readers, not the vnderſtandings of iudicious. Take you
<pb facs="tcp:150642:3"/>then this admirable hiſtory to your protection, and giue it that eſteeme your iudgments find it worthy of, that it may be your Square to direct you, and incitement to you to drawe you on, to the like, and greater atchiuements of honour.

Many other commodityes beſids drew him rather to attempt this towne them any other; as, the ground commodions for the drawnig of Trenches, raiſing of Banks and Batteryes, or any other work either of encamping or aſſaulting; the Riuer couenient for watring, eaſy to be shut vp, by which the beſeiged might be vtterly depriued of all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; woods neare for fuell; ſtore of fruitfull feilds for forrage: and laſtly this concurred, that Breda being poſſeſt, Berghen op Zome and other neighbouring Townes might with leſſe difficulty be recouered.</p>

Neither had we at our backs the conueniency of a Riuernauigable by Boats of any burden for the carriage of our victualls. And Breda was shut in, neare at hand, with a theater, as it were, of enemy-Townes about it. It remayned that our Corne and other prouiſion was to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by great numbres of wagons, and long iourneyes, hindred by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150642:10"/>the winter ſeaſon, which queſtionleſſe could not be performed either without imminent daunger, or double the forces we had then in the feild.</p>

Our ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Berghen op Zome, for which the enemy made ſuch boaſts, was ſcarſe yet well diſgeſted. Germany, wearied out with warres, tooke breath againe. The forces and reputation of the baſtard Manſfeild were now almoſt extinct. The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts of peace made with the Kings of England and Fraunce were inuiolably kept.

Spinola being tould of this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and being deſirous to informe him ſelfe of the truth of the buiſnes, as one not eaſily giuing credit to euery idle report, called preſently ſome of his Coronells vnto him; demaunding whether their ſouldiers ſuffered ſuch want of water as he was made beleiue. But they, either fearfull to diſcouer the errour of the place choſen for our Campe, or meaſuring other mens ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsityes by their owne plenty, being deſirous with all to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, made anſwer that their ſouldiers, wanted not water. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this the Marqueſſe in preſence of the Coronells called for him who had complained of that want, who whilſt he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the iuſtification of what he had ſaid, Count Iohn Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau Coronell of two Regiments of Germains came in oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely who making a relation of his ſouldiers neceſsityes confirmed what the other had complained of before.<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe finds out the truth.</note> VVhere vppon one of the ſtanders by who before had refuſed to acknowledg

By the extreame heats of the yeare, forty thouſand loaues of Bread were corrupted in Gilſen Campe. Almoſt about the ſame tyme the Cabins of two Italian Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by an vnlucky accident, were ſet on fire and brunt. To all which extremityes, whilſt to that day no wages had ben paid to the ſouldier, and the prices of all marchandize grew to be exceſsiue, diuers of our men began to forſake their Colours; which Spinola miſtruſting would proue an example to many more he ſought to redreſſe it by the rigour of Iuſtice.<note place="margin">Iuſtice done vppon ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vvhich ranne avvay from their Colours.</note> Four or fiue of theſe runne-awayes were taken in their flight and brought back againe, whoſe tryall he cauſed to be put to fortune, and the dice condemned one of them to dy. Meane while many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall diſcourſes were euery where heard in the Campe: that the tyme of action was ſpent in conſulting, and that our reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſouldiers were loſt with delayes.<note place="margin">The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes ſcoffs againſt the King, and Spinola.</note> By the enemy many reproachfull things were done in ſcorne of the King, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola.

Ridiculous pictures, of the King ſeeking Breda with a lanterne, Spinola ſtanding by him, ſcratching his head with both his hands, were euery where to be bought: to which there were not wanting ſatiricall Balads and Rimes.

            <p>The reſolution of beſeiging Graue was now approued by the

            <p>This manner of Spinolaes encamping,<note place="margin">Spinolaes manner of proceeding begets doubts in Count Maurice.</note> was cauſe that count Maurice could neither conceaue what we ſeriouſly intended, or what we only gaue out and made shew of, or whether our purpoſe were to attempt Graue or Breda, or both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, or any other Towne: which thing begat ſo many doubts in his mind, that, whilſt he durſt not draw part of his garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of one Towne for the releife of the other, and had not forces ſufficient to ſecure them both from daunger, he could in the meane tyme prouide well for neither.

Aſwell the Forts as Redouts were thirteene foot high from the ground on the outſide, and equally one with an other fifteene foot thick, the diches of them both being equally twelue foot broad, and eight foot deepe, with the ſides of the ditch cut ſcarping, as the outward face or forme of both works was made in like manner riſing with a ſcarpe, fortified with sharpe ſparres, aboue the middle of the wall, to entertayne and entangle ſuch as should attempt an aſcent. On the inſide, theſe works were raiſed eight foot high perpendicularly, at which heigth a VValke was made fiue foot broad, fortified round with a Parapet as many foot high, to couer our Muſqueters, and beare of the enemyes shot. The entraunce to them was vppon a planke or ſtock of a Tree throwne ouer the ditch, before which was a halfe moone, bending cubit-wiſe with one corner outward, and ſome of theſe halfe Moones had a palliſado with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.

But the earth of this cauſey was at the firſt ſo ſoft and yeilding, that it could not beare the weight of wagons and horſes, till afterwards, that it was ſtrewed with boords, and then it was able to beare great-peices of Artillery. This worke, Ingeners and others acquainted with the places therabouts, counſelled,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150642:32"/>as a thing neceſſary, to be raiſed in that place,<note place="margin">The reaſon why this Cauſey was rayſed in this place.</note> bycauſe the ground lay low, and the Meddowes of their owne nature were watry, to which the champion waters ouerflowing, and the Riuer Merke ſwelling ouer its banks, did riſe of that heigth in the winter ſeaſon, that it was nauigable in that place, ſo that prouiſion might that way be conueyed, by boats, into the Towne, and our Quarters ly ſeperated one from the other.</p>
            <p>VVhilſt theſe things were doing, Spinola ceaſed not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to ride about the Campe, encouraging the Coronells and Captains,<note place="margin">The dilige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce vſed in rayſing out vvorks.</note> and calling vppon ſuch as had care of the works: and as to a willing mind nothing ſeemes ouer haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he gaue order himſelf that fresh men should ſupply the places of ſuch as were tyred, in ſo much that the night it ſelf was not exempted from working. By which induſtry it came to paſſe, that our two Trenches of ſo larg an extent, togeather with ſo many Forts and Redouts, almoſt in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene dayes were finished, by a handfull of men. But the infinite concurſe of principall men of note, flocking thither from all parts to better their knowlegd in the arts of VVarre, and the examples of many Princes, who drawne thither by the fame and name of this Seige, tooke pay emongſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and meaner ſort af Souldiers, and with their owne hands cut Turfe, and carried Fagots, was a great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the diſpatch of this worke. Beſids this there aroſe from theſe workes a benefit of no ſmall importance for the releife of the Souldiers wants by which thing alone our whole Army was preſerued from disbanding: for being the ſouldiers wages were but ſeldome, and then but halfe paid,<note place="margin">The ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vvants releiued by vvorking for money.</note> and the rates of all prouiſion grew to he deare, ready money was paid to ſuch as were willing to beſtow their labours in working, and as new works were dayly let to hire till the end of the Seige, ſo the ſouldiers paynes euer brought them in ready money. But diuers of them choſe rather to beg,<note place="margin">The vanity of ſome ſouldiers,</note> then to releiue their wants by the gayne of their labour, a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150642:33"/>thing which to moſt men appeared extreame vanity, to few or none, wiſdome, that the needy man, for point of honour, should chooſe to beg and want victualls, rather then to liue well by ſome honeſt employment of his paynes. How beit two things did much eaſe the ſufferings of our ſouldiers: firſt the ſituation of our Campe,<note place="margin">The ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Campe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Breda, better ther that of Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</note> far better then that of Gilſen (for here we had a Riuer and many ſmall brooks for watring; a rich ſoile, and Barnes (the Corne being already reaped) plentifully ſtored:) to which, ſecondly, this concurred, a continuall good temper of the ayre almoſt all the tyme our ſouldiers were buiſied in felling of woods, making fagots, carrying boughes, cutting Turfe, or rayſing trenches or other workes.

The garde of the great Fort, on the right hand, which the Baron of Beauoix had now almoſt finished, was committed to the Burgundians.

The fort was Canon proofe. The Curtaynes were a hundred and twenty foot long, eight and twenty foot thick, fifteene foot high, which were ſtuck round with sharpe long ſparres, to make the abbord, to the fort, more difficult. On the inſide was a walke vppon the wall, with a Parapet fiue foot high, and ten foot thick, about which a foot ſtep was raiſed. On the out ſide, a ditch was ſunke ten foot deepe, two and twenty foot broad vppon the

This man, it ſeemes, had ben bred only to reueng the death of his Father, as if otherwiſe his owne ruyne would haue fallen vppon him too late: For he had, ſome dayes before, ſent a Trumpet to Spinola, requeſting he might be permitted to combat the ſonne of his Fathers Murderer (ſo he termed yong Grobbendonck.) But Spinola had refuſed him (putting a garde vppon yong Grobbendonck, leaſt he should eſcape.) Briaute therfore caſt about for this other occaſion, being a yong man of a firy and daring Spirit.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150642:43"/>knowing that ſtratagems require tyme, and that it is vnſafe to attempt great enterpriſes with out deliberation, had contriued, in the night tyme, to fall vppon Anwerp Caſtle at vnawares: which he did in this ſort.

The ſouldiers of Roſendale and the Campe were made beleiue they should march to Berghen op Zome; they of Berghen op Zome were tould they should march towards the Campe.

For (with Auguſtus) he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, who with imminent daungers looke after ſmall gaine, to ſuch as fish with a goulden hooke, the loſſe of which cannot be repaired by any thing they take. In concluſion Count Maurice hauing done nothing before Breda,<note place="margin">Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice ſets fire on his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyreth from Mede.</note> two and twenty dayes after his encamping at Made, gaue order for the fyring of his Cabbins, and packing of bag and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and retired from thence penſiue, and neuer after to returne back againe. It is reported he was ſcarſe euer after ſeene of his Army, ſo far he was from deſiring any eaſe of his ſorrow. Spinola diſcouering the continuall ſmoaks of thoſe fires, with many troupes of horſe rode towards the enemyes Campe, and found it without ſouldiers, the reare of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being then vppon the retreat.<note place="margin">The deſire of ſome of our men to make shevv of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in ſight of their Generall.</note> Here all men, in the eye of their Generall, were deſirous to make ſome shew of their valour, diuers of our ſouldiers attempting to chaſe ſuch, of the enemyes men out of their Quarter, as remayned for the ſafer retreat of their whole Army, but by the turning of greater forces vppon them, they retyred themſelues fairely.

Otherwiſe, this retreat of Count Maurices was performed with ſuch order, that it begat him as much honour, as his enterpriſe vnfortunately ended cauſed afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him. So that he might well ſay with Antigonus, making the like retreat, that he did not runne away, but that he proſecuted his owne aduantage, preſenting it ſelf to him: In this retreat he had ſuch a regard of his owne, and his mens ſafety, that he was able to ſaue him ſelf from any ſuddaine aſſault of Spinola, by the works he had rayſed, and cut of all poſsibility of purſuing him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The cauſey of Swoll reached to the vttermoſt part of his Campe, in which place the way of Seuenberg begins:<note place="margin">Works rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Maurice for the retreat of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> vppon the entrance of which Cauſey he had caſt vp a fort, to retire his men into. On the ſide of the Cauſey he ſunck a deepe ditch, drawing a parapet at length vppon the Cauſey it ſelfe to couer his men as they marched away. Hither they might ſafely repaire; from hence they might defend the reſt of their men marching, if any greate troupes of ours should, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, charg them; and out of this place they might ſecurely ſally, hauing this trench at their backs to retyre back againe: for that work was ſo ſollid and high, that it could not be attempted but by ſcaling ladders on the ſide, and in the front, only by one paſſage, and that exceding narrow: in the reare an other worke shut in this parapet, in which place the Cauſey of Terheyde was cut aſunder, leaſt our men might fall vppon them, that way, in their retreat.

Though the only name of this Commaunder were fearfull to the enemy, yet his deeds did more ſcarre them, in theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, then his fame. His manner of proceeding was this. In the morning, before day, he gaue commaund to put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſordred multituds of Carriages and wagons, then, ſending firſt ſome troupes of horſe before to diſcouer, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to march.

He prouided, with all diligence poſsible, that the wayes leaſt ſubiect to ambushes should be made choiſe of, cauſing them to be repaired for the greater eaſe of his wagons. If word were brought him of any daunger, he had a care not to come to blowes in places of diſaduantage, and therfore, he either made a ſtay in places fit for him, or els made haſt out of thoſe places of daunger, making vſe of his wagons, in ſteed of a Trench, drawing his men within them, if there were daunger of being charged.

The report of which exact diſcipline, ſo punctually obſerued, was cauſe that the enemy neuer durſt attempt our Conuoyes: And the like honours done heretofore to Alexander Seuerus for his modeſty and reſtraint in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Army againſt the Parthians,<note place="margin">Count He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry called by the Croats, God of the Peſant.</note> were nowdone to Count Henry vanden Berghe by the Croats, who ſtiled him the God of the Peſants for the care he euer had of the Cuntry people.</p>

And,<note place="margin">He forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the horſewhich garded the prourſion to enter into the Campe.</note> leaſt what remayned of our forrage should come short for the horſe of the Campe, he commaunded that the horſe which garded the prouiſion should be lodged in the neareſt Townes and Villages therabouts, there to refresh themſelues, whilſt the wagons, and prouiſion was making ready at Lyre: and, that thoſe horſes, when they had garded the prouiſion to the Campe, might not waſt the Campe forrage; he gaue a ſtrict commaund that none of them should enter with in the trench, and diſmiſſed all Carts and carriage-horſes ſo ſoone as they were vnladen. By which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150642:49"/>meanes it came to paſſe, that our Horſe comming to full fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding elswhere, in a short tyme became fat, and in good caſe. And that theſe things might be done with more ſecurity, he cauſed a large fortification to be raiſed at Barle (a Village three howers iourney diſtant from Breda) lodging a good garriſon in it, with one troupe of horſe. To his place after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Count Henry conueyed the prouiſion with his horſe.

            <p>Meane while,<note place="margin">Our four ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſubiect to daunger.</note> whilſt our ſouldiers forraged and ſought wood ſomewhat farther from the Campe then ordinarily they were wont (all forrage and wood neare at hand being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed) the enemy conceaued that, ſeing them ſo ſcattered and diſperſed in their forraging, with their horſe, they might eaſily cut them in peeces. VVherfore they had euer a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye vppon vs, and tooke all courſes poſsible to hinder vs from wood and forrage, which they imagined to be a thing leſſe difficult bycauſe they ouer-matched vs in horſe, ours, for the moſt part, being all employed, either in garding our Camp or conducting our prouiſion. It was indifferent to them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they cut our men in peeces, or tooke away their carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without which our Seige could not be maintayned. Hence it came to paſſe (a thing not to be auoyded) that whilſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150642:54"/>was to be ſought in houſes ſcatterd and diſperſed,<note place="margin">The enemy began to intercept our forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> our forragers now and then were intercepted, in by wayes, by ſome ſmall troupes of the enemyes horſe, which though it did vs not any great hurt, yet ſomwhat it endomaged our ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers boyes, Carters, and horſes. Spinola, that the enemy might not long enioy ſo much as this poore triumph, expected,<note place="margin">VVe ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome loſſes, though ſmall.</note> from thence forward, the returne of thoſe forces, with which Count Henry garded our prouiſion, within three leagues of the Army, vnder the protection of which troupes our men forraged euer after ſecurely in all Cuntry Villages round about our Campe. And for his prouiſion he tooke ſuch a courſe,<note place="margin">Spinolaes care to ſaue our forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from daunger.</note> that at the ſame tyme the wagons were lading wheat at Lyre, Oats were tranſported to the Camp in other Carts, ſending a competent number of horſe and foot to gard them; which carts being firſt vnladen in the Campe, the ſouldier might returne to Lyre, in good tyme, to garde the reſt of the prcui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Army. In the meane tyme ſuch horſe as by long labour and leaneneſſe were almoſt become vnſeruiceable, were ſent thither to garriſon, wher forrage was more plenty, whilſt other horſes ſupplied their places, to whom afterwards, in like manner, their Quarters were aſigned to refresh. Thus by the redoubling of tourneyes, with horſe fresh and in good caſe, he quickly tranſported his forrage and Corne. The charge of which was committed to Alexander Heyſe lieutenant of the Artillery, who employed his whole endeauours in the ſpeedy lading, and ridding of wagons.</p>
            <p>But after that the Cuntry (with whoſe approbation this tranſportation of our forrage and Corne was exacted) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the Seige to continew, and new exactions,<note place="margin">The Cuntry finds the charge of wagons to be too great for them to continew.</note> euery day follow, vppon the neck of the former, being wearied out with the expences of continuall ſupplyes of wagons, were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger able to defray ſo great a charge; a new courſe was thought on for the tranſportation of prouiſion. In all willages Carts with two wheeles were taken vp at hire, which by reaſon of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150642:55"/>the wide ſtanding a ſunder of the wheeles, often tymes one horſe,<note place="margin">A neweour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe taken for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of our proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> for the moſt part two horſes were able to draw, with much more eaſe, then three horſes drew thoſe other wagons of four leſſer wheeles. A price was agreed on for theſe Carts, deare at the beginning, by reaſon of the ill wayes but, afterwards, in better weather,<note place="margin">The benefit we reaped by this new inuention.</note> the price was leſned by half. And thus our prouiſion, with leſſe charge, by far, of horſes and wagons, with leſſe waſt of forrage, with the ſame expedition, and in the ſame quantity, was eaſily tranſported.</p>
            <p>This new inuention deceaued Count Maurice, who relying principally vppon the ſeaſon of the yeare, aſſured him ſelf we should neuer be able to ouercome the inconueniences of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing our Campe with prouiſion; ſo far fetched, and ſo tedious to be brought; the rather, bycauſe winter was already at hand, and all Corne therabouts was conueyed in to Townes, all Villages, far and neare, being vtterly diffurnished, and Cattel, for feare of warre, being driuen farther of. It is reported that Count Maurice emongſt ſome of his people; should vayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly vtter thoſe ſpeeches which Pompey, heretofore, vſed of Caeſar at Dyrrachium:<note place="margin">Cout Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola.</note>

And indeed except the hand of God had more aſsiſted vs flill then the power of man, and the winter (at other tymes sharpe) had not at this tyme ben ſtrangely temperate, it had ben impoſsible to endure the difficultyes of this Seige. It cannot be denied but thoſe flouds which the towneſmen, in Nouember, turned vppon our Camp, when, ſtopping the mouthes of the Riuers, they began to caſt vp a bancke to make the Merke and the Aa ouerflow far and neare, did, beyond meaſure, moleſt and ſcarre vs.

That the Towneſmen accuſtomed to plenty, vnacquainted with warre and famine, would neuer be able to endure great wants. That the French, Scottish, English and low-Countrimen (of all which there were diuers garriſoned in the Towne) would not haue patience ſo long till their Corne and other prouiſion should begin to faile. That ſome of them by nature, others by cuſtome did more affect delicacyes; and for theſe reaſons we perſwaded our ſelues, they would not be able long to hould out: ſo eaſy a thing it is to take Armes when men pleaſe, but hard to diſengage themſelues till their enemy thinck good.<note place="margin">The means by which the beſeiged held out the longer.</note> But, beſids all that Corne with which euery towneſmen was commaunded to furnish him ſelfe, and which was prouided in the publike ſtorehouſe for the ſouldier, the peſants (in that tyme our Army lay at Gilſen, and could not conueniently ſtop all their paſſages) for feare of a Seige, tranſported great ſtore of prouiſion to the Towne. Moreouer the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronells and Captaines for the notable gaine they made, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating, to their owne vſe, the wages of their dead ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, were the better contented to endure inconueniencyes, and this ſo much the rather, by how much the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

Theſe things deceaued not vs alone, but generally the opinions of the beſeiged themſelues (beſids that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders, men otherwiſe of greater credit and reputation, had in a manner engaged the truſt repoſed in them, to their owne priuate gaine) and diuers runne-awayes out of the Towne made report that except ſuccours were ſuddainely ſent them, they could not be able to hould out much longer: the ſame was written out of Holland to Count Henry van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bergh. A certayne Germane ſouldier who had ſerued the ſpace of nine monethes vnder the Hollander, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by our men,<note place="margin">A ſtratagem of Count Iſenbrug</note> and knowne by Count Iſenburgh, to be a ſubiect of his, hauing his pardon graunted, was ſent vppon thoſe termes back into the Towne, that when he perceaued the Towne brought to extremityes, he should returne to our Camp, aſſuring him his life and a reward for his paynes: after two mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes that this ſouldier had remayned in Breda, conuerſant emongſt the ſouldiers, without any ſuſpicion, he returned againe and brought word, that the want, in the Towne was ſuch, that they began now generally to feed vppon horſe flesh, and that

That they deſired that Spinola would oftner batter the Towne, for a coulour, at leaſt, that they might find ſome good pretence to render themſelues. To theſe reports ſome men giuing an attentiue eare, who willingly beleeue any thing they deſire should come to paſſe, could neither perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Count Henry his intelligence to be falſe, nor that the German ſouldier would ly ſo groſly, in ſo notable a buiſnes, or that all the runnawayes were generally impoſters; importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spinola to giue way, that fire balls might be shot into the Towne.

About that tyme returned oportunely to the Camp Phillip Count Mansfeild, late Coronell of the garde of Adolphus King of Swethland, famous for the taking in of Riga, where he had the ſupreme command of the Army.<note place="margin">Philip Con<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Mansfeld inuenteth a new kind Artillery.</note> He adding Art to experience (as vſe is the maſter of all things) had found out a certayne new inuention of Artillery, eaſier to be drawne then the ordinary Artillery, which, with a leſſe quantity of pouder would carry their balls farther, and by that meanes be infinitely ſeruiceable in theſe warrs: for the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which buiſnes he had purpoſely taken a iourney from the Camp to Bruxells, and cauſed forty braſſe peeces and three and twenty Morters for fire-balls, to be caſt.

VVith the third part of pouder they carried their balls farther then our ordinary old peeces. This aduantage Count Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild gained by his experience, hauing found out the art of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering his metall in ſuch ſort, when it was diſſolued, that he gaue it the ſame hardnes the greateſt peeces had notwithſtanding his mettall was more ſubtile, and thinner by far, by which means they came to be ſo much the lighter; And the Balls were, in that reſpect, carried farther, with a leſſecharge of powder, bycauſe the touch-hole of theſe peeces, tooke not fire vppon a flat ground, but in the vttermoſt end of the peece (for there was the center of the touch-hole) vppon a riſing ground, made hollow to the shape of a ſpeare head, contrary to the old peeces, to which fire was giuen on the top, betwixt the ball and the flatnes of the ground. Hence proceeded the greater force of the new peeces, bycauſe the fire giuen in the vttermoſt part of the peece, is drawne with equall force into a circle, which being all gathered togeather with in that hollow place,<note place="margin">An other inuention of Count Mansfeilds.</note> throwes out their Balls with much more violence.</p>

Aertſen the Droſſards wife to encourage the dishartned towneſmen; at what tyme our Canon-balls flew thickeſt about the Towne, cauſed her ſelf to be drawne in her Coche, about the walls, making shew of a manly ſpirit in a womans body, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution being, to her, in lieu of a rampier. VVhilſt the enemyes affaires ſtood thus, it was commonly bruited that Count Maurice and the ſtates had conceaued ſome cauſe of offence againſt one an other, for the ill direction and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of buiſneſſes: The States, that he had giuen Spinola ſo much leiſure, to fortify his Camp (ſpending his tyme in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantling the walls of Cleue;<note place="margin">The States and Count Maurice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate and blame one an other.</note>) that after two and twenty dayes vnneceſſarily ſpent, he retired his Camp from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de without doing any thing. Count Maurice on the other ſide layd the fault vppon the States, offering to quit the charge he had vnder them, emongſt whom he muſt both ſerue their turns, and follow euery mans humour. That he left it to them to conſider, whether they had conferred more honour vppon him, then he had brought in profit to them, VVith this anſwer the States being troubled, miſtruſting that he intended indeed to quit his charge, they acknowledged him without controle, to be their ſupreme commaunder, and that they neither miſtruſted his truſt, nor diſcretion, but that they had only made mention of ſuch things, as ſeemed to them would haue prooued to their aduantage: that he would be pleaſed to continew to protect their Common wealth with his valour, and manage the warre wholy at his owne command: that they would make it appeare how much they tooke Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150642:58"/>to hart, ſparing no charges to ſaue it, for that only reſpect, that it was the patrimony of the Naſſawes. Count Maurice being pacified with theſe promiſes and excuſes, that he might not ſeeme to neglect the care of the Commonwealth, gaue order that a thouſand horſe should be leauied and armed at his owne charg. The States themſelues rayſed a thouſand more, to reinforce thoſe troupes which were expected out of France. Emongſt other things, they conſulted about the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a great damme to ſtop the courſe of the Riuer Merke, not far from Seuenbergh: which only courſe they thought now left for the safty of Breda, if, as often as the ſpring tide came in, the ſea ouerflowing all the low grounds, and the winter flouds, (which runne by little brooks into the Riuer) being kept in, they could put vnder water all meddowes far and neare:<note place="margin">A new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tept of the ſtates to ſue cour Breda.</note> that thoſe waters would either ouerflow our Camp, or els ſerue to put prouiſion, by boats, into the towne: VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vndertooke this worke, a thing of infinite labour and expence.<note place="margin">They inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to turne the courſe of te Riuer by raiſing a damme in it.</note> They ſent to Seuenbergh Boats, Barks, and wherryes (of which they haue great ſtore) from thence to repaire to a certayne place called <hi>Lamſgat,</hi> where the mouth of the Riuer is, and in which place, the Banks lying low, the Riuer is fulleſt of fords and shallow places.

VVhen he arriued at the place, he found that a hundred ſpades would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the filling of that ditch: notwithſtanding, ſending ſome of his men before, he made triall what might be done. Our horſe Centinell who watched not far from that place, gaue notice of it by the diſcharging of his piſtoll, by which he warned our Camp to be ready in Armes. but Staken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brouck, finding himſelf diſcouered, commaunded all his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets to ſound an alarum, and retired, being ſatisfied only with diſquieting our Camp.

The froſt breaking vp, the work-men (though the ſwiftnes of the Riuer was a mayne difficulty propoſed againſt the going forward of that damme) returned againe to their worke left of, ſinking three long carriage Boats, laden with turfe and ſtones, and caſting in ſtore of fagots and earth vppon them: which done, they began to raiſe the damme from both ſides of the Riuer, throwing in rowes of turfe, with great ſtakes rammed betwixt them, the better to bind the earth, towards the midſt of the channel. At Seuenberg they made ſluces, on the other ſide of the Riuer, to keepe in, and let out the tyde, that the feilds being once ouerflowed, they might ſtill be kept ſo deepe vnder water, as should be needfull to beare boats laden with prouiſion. Hauing expected therfore the change of the tide, they put all things in readines for the arming of their boats.</p>

And that the worke might go on, without intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they rayſed heapes of turfe, like rocks, in low places (at ſuch tymes as the ebbe had carried away the water) that at high water they might, by boats, be tranſporting ſuch turfe as appeared aboue the water.

            <p>Spinola being now furnished with ſuch an Army as the like had ſeldome ben ſeene in the low Countryes (for it conſiſted of <hi>30000.</hi> foot and <hi>8000.</hi> horſe, beſids the ordinary garriſons of all frontiere townes) let ſlip no occaſion, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayndure of the Seige, by which he might intercept the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Count Maurice, and the beſeiged, ſo to come to know what their deſignes were.

Three ſeuerall perſons were cbſerued to haue paſſed into the towne, either through the careleſnes of our Centinells, or through their owne ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. In the place were theſe men paſſed, ſome few dayes after, a little purſe was found, by ſome who were curious in ſeeking therebouts,<note place="margin">Two letters of Count Maurices intercepted.</note> in which were two letters, beſmeared ouer with wax, the better to be preſerued againſt all waters they might fall into.<note place="margin">The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Rontart decipreth them.</note> They were both from Count Maurice, the one to the Gouernour, the other to the Senate of Breda, written in ſuch ciphers, as could hardly be deciphred.

            <p>
               <q>That he was much comforted to vnderſtand of the great ſtore of corne found emongſt the towneſmen. That now their care ought to be, by a moderate diſtribution of it, to make it hould out, till he could be able to ſend ſuccours to them, for which, great preparation was making in England, France, and the vnited Prouinces. That, for that purpoſe, Count Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild was at hand, who by ioyning his forces to theirs, might rayſe Spinola from his Seige. That they were long ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150642:67"/>and had ben there already, if they had not ben croſsed by tempeſt, and foule weather. That <hi>2000.</hi> french horſe were already at Bologne and <hi>14000.</hi> English foot ready to embarque at Douer (beſids other looſe troups in the land of Leige and other places.) That the reſt of the foot forces to the number of <hi>2000.</hi> raiſed, by him, in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and the vnited Prouinces, lay ready embarqued, waiting their oportunity, and faire weather. That they had once already put to Sea, but were put back by foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That the States would neither ſpare labour nor char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to further Mansfeilds deſignes, and ſuccour Breda, for which purpoſe they had taken order for the rayſing of <hi>4000.</hi> new horſe, beſides the horſe of the old Army, in England and Fraunce, where alſo they were now rayſing ſix or ſeauen thouſand foot more then ordinary: ſo that about the beginning of ſpring, they were in hope to haue an Army of <hi>40000.</hi> foot and <hi>6000.</hi> horſe, with which they would find ſome means to releiue Breda: which that it might be effected to the moſt aduantage of their Army, and the Towne, he deſired that the corne (mentioned in the Gouernours let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) might be made hould out till the firſt of May next enſuing: which, from the tenth of that preſent Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, was a hundred and eight dayes. That, though he was confident their forces would be much ſooner ready, yet he requeſted they would ſpare their Corne, as much as was poſsible, that his owne Army, and the other, which yet lay-expecting vppon the borders of France, might haue ſo much the more liberty to come to him at their eaſe. That wheras the Gouernour had formerly written to him, to know his opinion about ſtinting the ſouldiers and towneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with their wiues and children, to a ſet proportion of Corne; is was to be noted, that men, for the moſt part, eate moſt at ſuch tymes, when they ar proportioned to a ſet allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; at other tymes, they buy not more then ordinarly is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150642:68"/>for them, eſpecially when corne is to be had for money. Beſids, that it was a thing would giue occaſion of tumult, how impartially ſoeuer the diſtribution were made. That he therfore left it wholy to the diſcretion of the Senate, and Counſell of warre there, to determine what they thought moſt conuenient for the ſparing of their Corne. That he had treated with the States, to know what their pleaſure was should be done with the ſouldiers horſes, when their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was ſpent. That they had engaged themſelues they would repay to the horſemen, what money ſoeuer they might haue had more for their horſes, being aliue, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they should ſell them for, being dead; prouided, the horſmen valued them at a reſonable rate: wherfore they should not ſpare, for the publike good, freely to kill their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to mantayne their hunger the longer. That, as long as any forrage remayned, they should preſerue their milch-kine to their ovtmoſt extremity (milke being a thing ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and vefull.) And, though it was not to be doubted at all, but he had lately, with the Senate, made a ſtraight ſearch, ouer all the Burgers Cellars and granaryes: that he beſought him againe, notwithſtanding, euer to haue a care, to mantayne the publike ſtore as much as lay in him, if peraduenture any man, by ſtealth, should chance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his prouiſion. That the Magiſtrates had enformed him of the affections of the people, ready, with their purſes and prouiſions to ſupply all, wants and neceſsityes of the Seige, but with all, that complaints were brought to him of the inſolencyes of ſome ſouldiers, who, though they had no reaſon to complaine, either of their lodging, fire, wages, or deare rates of any prouiſion; yet were not afraid, as well by day, as by night, to breake open houſes, ſpoile gardens, breake downe hedges, pillage ſtables, shops, and the very Cabins them ſelues; and theſe things, for want of a ſtrict obſeruation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, and ſuffering ſome ſouldiers to ſcape vnpunished, who
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150642:68"/>had ben taken in thoſe offences. VVhich thing, out of doubt, would cauſe a remiſnes in the Burgers, who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to had ben punctuall in keeping their guards, and who already began to mutter that their owne houſes were more pretious to them, then the towne walls, and were the rather to be made good againſt their domeſticall enemy. That he deſired therfore, if ſuch inſolences should happen hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſeuere iuſtice might be done vppon the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, ſo to terrify others from committing the like: that ſouldiers ar placed in garriſon, with intention to defend, not to offend the inhabitants of the townes where they liue. That his deſire was, theſe his letters should be shewed to the Coronells, and all others of the Councell of warre, whom he beſought to take ſome ſerious courſe that the towneſmen, who otheruiſe had a ſufficient share of ſuffering, might be freed, and ſecured from theſe inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable abuſes. That he had had intelligence, from other places, of the new Cauſey made by the enemy; of their Counterſcarp caſt vp vppon that cauſey which goes to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenberg; and of the ſtrong palliſado of tres made before it. That notwithſtanding, the States deſiſted not from choaking vp the channel of the Riuer, neare Seuenberg, which worke would be finished out of hand: though it remayned a thing vncertayne, in moſt mens opinions, what ſucceſſe this ſtopping of the channel was like to haue: Some were of opinion it would drowne all feilds far and neare about the Towne; others beleeued otherwiſe. That, for his part, he would ſuſpend his iudgment, till he had ſeene the euent. Yet, that he was not ignorant (whether it were poſsible or no to choake vp that channel) that thoſe feilds were of ſuch a vaſtnes, as without a world of waters, they could not be drowned; and that thoſe waters would not ſo eaſily make a paſſage for them through the enemyes cauſey which was ſo ſollidly made, and fortified ſo ſtrong. Yet
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150642:69"/>howſoeuer, that that worke would much moleſt the enemy, when he on the other ſide, with his Army, should come to ſuccour the towne. VVherfore it would not be out of purpoſe, if againſt that tyme, he made ready ſome boats, to ſecond him, out of the towne. This was the ſubſtance of the letter. At the bottome of the letter this was added: that Mansfeilds Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had once againe put to Sea, but was put back by a contrary wind. That Lambert Charles Gouernour of Nimegen, had ſurpriſed the towne of Goch.</q>

That his purpoſe was, without any ſiniſter intent, only to paſſe through the Kings Cuntry to ſuch places, as, to comply with the king of England his Maſters commaund, he muſt of neceſsity paſſe vnto. That he would not without her prtuity make any offer to paſſe, bycauſe he was confident she would not refuſe him paſſage; but if peraduenture she should chance to refuſe him, that then he was reſolued to make his one paſſage by force, which, relying vppon the iuſtice and equity of his cauſe, he aſſured himſelfe he should find eaſy.</q>

A watchfull eye was had ouer the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, by their Captaines, as often as they were obſerued to whiſper togeather in any troupes, and by the interuention of the Captaines, their diſcourſes were broaken of. By theſe and the like preuentions, the towne was ſome what the longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and the dishartned towneſmen and ſouldiers were encouraged, though from that tyme forewards, their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150642:72"/>wants, for the moſt part, were fed with bare hopes. Now at laſt Count Maurice was arriued at Gertruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg with his foot forces, and now againe the power of heauen ſeemed to conteſt with him.<note place="margin">Mansfeild loſt many men by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt in the very har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Gertruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</note> The winds and tempeſts droue his ships, with that violence, one againſt the other, in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that diuers of them were broken, and became vtterly vnſeruiceable: on the other ſide, as if the cold of the whole winter had benreſerued to that tyme, an extreame sharpe froſt cloſed vp all Riuers, that, in many dayes, prouiſion could not be brought to them. It is a knowne cuſtome of them of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudenberg, that, out of the confidence they haue in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall nauigation, and neighbouring townes, they neuer hord vp any ſtore of corne, or other prouiſion. Hence it came to paſſe, that, vppon the ſuddaine arriuall of ſo many ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, a great want followed, and ſcarcity of all things; the rather, bycauſe by the vnexpected great froſt, all paſſages were ſo frozen, that nothing could be brought in.

And which was moſt of all to be lamented, whilſt Mansfeild was afraid to put his men on shore, the moſt of which were preſt, and ſerued againſt their will, they came to perish by that means, by which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150642:73"/>thought to preſerue them; by being reſtrained from going a shore. Diuers of them, notwithſtanding, eſcaping by flight, halfe ſterued, vnarmed, and in pittifull plight, reported themſelues to be in far better caſe, then the reſt of the Army which remayned behind, who were, for the moſt part, preſt men, ignorant of their trade, and ſuch as were yet to learne the handling of their Armes, when now they should haue ben fit to bring into the feild. It is reported of ſome of them, that they charged their peeces with all their pouder,<note place="margin">The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and vnskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſome of Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilds new ſouldiers.</note> at once which was diſtributed to them for ſeuerall charges, filling the whole bore of the Muſquet ſo full, that ſcarſe any place remayned to receaue their bullet: ſo rawe and vnskilfull theſe men were at the beginning. It appeared by many letters that thoſe troupes were rayſed out of the ſcumme of the people, and that in a short ſpace, they were ſo leſned, what with deſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and what with running away, that of forteene thouſand men, ſcarſe four thouſand remayned. VVhilſt Mansfeilds fleet lay thus fas froſen, the oportunity of the ſeaſon put vs in mind of ſandry exploits. Nordam fort, neare Seuenberg, inacceſsible in the ſummer, by reaſon of the waters, might now, vppon the Ice,<note place="margin">Diuers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpuſes propoſed to vs to which the ſeaſon of the yeare with other concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeemed to inuite vs to.</note> haue ben attemped, on foote: It was thought no hard matter, at that tyme, to take in Prinſland, Roſendale and Seuenberg. VVherfore ſpies were, euery where, ſent out to diſcouer: fire-balls were made ready, to through into the enemyes Boats. But in vayne, for the Ice (which ſeemed to be ſollid and hard frozen) was ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened with the continuall ſnow falling vppon it, that it would hardly beare the weight of three or four ſouldiers, at once; And the wayes, lying deep with ſnow, vneuen, blowne vp and downe, here and there in heapes with the wind, were infinite daungerous for ſquadrons of men to march. The ſpies themſelues fell, ſome breſt high, ſome mouth high, and were often tymes quite ouerwhelmed with the ſnow, that they could not heare, or help one an other. Three
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150642:73"/>of Coronell Fuggers ſouldiers, being reſolute bold fellowes, comming to the enemyes Campe at Roſendale, after they had made what diſcouery they could vppon the boats which lay there, drinking and diſcourſing, without ſuſpition with all men, were betrayed in their returne, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped but narrowly by flight, one of being taken, and grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiously wounded. At other tymes Fuggers men had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe in their exploits, and few of then often tymes, brought in many priſoners; But the ſucceſſe of ſtratagems is not euer alike. There wanted not ſome, who beſought Spinola, that with the forces of Don Carlos Coloma, and ſome of his troupes added to them, an attempt might be made vppon Roſendale, which was but ſlightly fortified, aſſuring him, that, according to the report of Spies, the enemy, there, ſtood in feare of vs, and would ſooner pack vp bag and baggage, and betake themſelues to flight, then to fight: they were perſwaded that this attempt might be made with out daunger, if, our horſe being diuided, were ſent, in the meane tyme, one half towards Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen op Zome, and the other towards Prinſland. Spinola, who alwayes gaue eare rather to ſafe and wary enterpriſes, grounded vppon reaſon, then to others which ſeemed plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and by accident only might chance to proue fortunate, weighing all things ſeriouſly wtth himſelf, and conſidering that that enterpriſe, would be little or nothing benefictall to his mayne deſigne, reſolued rather to reſerue his forces entire,<note place="margin">Spinolace warines in his vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any enterpriſe.</note> for ſome neceſſary occaſion, then to diſcourage his whole Army, with the opinion of the enemyes valour, or encourage the enemy, with their good ſucceſſe againſt vs, if peraduenture we should chaunce to receaue a ſoile, and faile in our enterpriſe, though with the loſſe of neuer ſo few men; knowing that in matters of warre, vppon ſlight occaſions, oftentymes, great alterations follow; and that it were not wiſdome, in a Generall, with imminent danger to purſue a ſlight Vctory. The fourth of March was now at hand, which was the Aniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

The Riuer could not now be diſtinguished from the shoare, or greene feilds; all things had the ſame face, all places ouerflowne. It neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more plainely, how much God fauoured our Army, in preſeruing it all that winter: for, if the winter had ben ſo hard, and ſuch quantity of ſwow had fallen, in the beginning, as did now at the later end, or as ordinarily falleth euery yeare in the winter ſeaſon, out of doubt, for that only reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, we should haue ben forced to forſake the Seige. For, during that short tyme of the extremity of cold, diuers ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had their limbs forzen, others were found dead whilſt they ſtood centinell: ſome of them had their hands and ſeet frozen, in ſuch ſort, that it was neceſſary afterwards to haue them cut of.

And generally, the conueyance of our prouiſion, was ſo hindred, that, for the ſpace of three weeks (all which tyme this great thew, and rayne endured in extremity) ſcanſe any proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was brought to the Campe, ſauing what the Germane ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers wiues, running out euery day in noups, as if they had marched in ſquadrons, to the neighbowring will ages, brought home vppon their shoulders. VVhich women beſids other offices of of duty they performed to their husbands, were continually buiſied in fetching burdens of wood, ſeeking of forrage,<note place="margin">The loue and reſpect of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſoul diers wiues to their thus bands.</note> dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their meat for them, washing ther linnen, and carrying their baggage vppon their shoulders, whenſouer the Campe marched; ſo that they ought rather to be cherished, and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150642:75"/>in this behalf, as neceſſary as Marius his Mules, then to be reckned emongſt the carriages, or impediments of a Campe.</p>
            <p>Theſe waters being fallen, the enemy began againe, with their former reſolution, to rayſe their damme begunne. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola cauſed the Sluces of a little brooke, called Terleure, which runnes into the Riuer Merk, to be broken, and to ſtop vp, and diuert the courſe of other brooks, which ranne into our Campe.<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their damme.</note> He raiſed, beſides, the cauſey, which he had cauſed to be made, in the meddow-grounds, from the Riuer Merk, towards Terhage three foot higher then it was before; that, how much ſoeuer thoſe ſtanding waters might chance to swell, no boats might be able to paſſe ouer that place. The enemy, to breake the force of the current, which came from Breda, a pretty diſtance before that place, where they intended to raiſe their damme, raiſed two ſmall promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes, vppon each shoare of the Riuer: and in the midſt of the Riuer (in that ſpace which remayned open, betwixt the two hills, or promontoryes, where the water, finding the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage narrower, ranne with the greateſt force) they rammed in great ſtocks of trees, one by the other, in an order which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the shape of a trident, leauing but little ſpace bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt them, that the force of the current, being firſt broaken there, might afterwards runne gently, and with leſſe danger of the damme. Behind this, they began to raiſe their damme, aſſured, as they thought of good ſucceſſe. They wrought continually, vppon this damme, many dayes and nights, and had brought it to ſuch perfection, hauing raiſed it from each shoare, that their remayned now, in the middle, but a ſmall gap to ſtop; but the force of the water, reſtrayned, was ſuch,<note place="margin">The force of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouer throweth their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</note> that wheras before the ſtreame ranne ſo gently, that it was hard to deſcerne whether it ranne vpward or downeward, now, the waters miſsing their ordinary free paſſage, ranne downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward like an impetuous vnreſiſtable Torrent. The palliſado
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150642:75"/>before the damme, was looſned at the bottome and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, by the remouing, and washing away of the ſand. To all which, there roſe ſo fearfull a tempeſt, about the ſame tyme, that the boats they had ſunke, the ſtones, turfe, fagots and trees which they had throwne into the Riuer, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their damme, were violently borne away, with the force of the ſtreame, and the fleet, in which Chriſtian Duke of Brunſwick had brought the french Cauallerie, ſuſtained great domage, diuers of his ships being loſt, others blowne into other quarters, not able to keep their courſe. Then, at laſt, the enemy, finding the loſſe of their infinite charges, thought it high tyme to deſiſt from thatworke, which they had ſo often before attempted in vayne.</p>
            <p>About that tyme certayne letters of the Gouernour of Breda to Count Maurice, and of Mansfeilds and Count Maurices agayne to the Gouernour,<note place="margin">Letters of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Breda to Count Maurice, and of Count Maurices and Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feirdsto the Gouernour intercepted by a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practiſe of a Peſant.</note> by which Spinola came to the knowledg of ſome ſecrets, which made much to his purpoſe, were intercepted, by the ſubtility of a Peſant, worth recounting. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne perſon in the Army, deſirous to shew himſelf induſtrious in the ſeruice, hauing found out a peſant, as expert of all places, and paſſages ther abouts, as ready to accomplish any thing, he should vndertake, perſwaded him, by faire promiſes to carry But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Tobacco, and cheeſe to the Towne, making shew of hauing narrowly, and with great danger, eſcaped our centinells, and gards; and there to offer his ſeruice to the Gouernour, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry letters from him to Count Maurice. The fellow, in whom, otherwiſe, little truſt was to be repoſed, gaping after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and hauing nothing but pouerty, of his owne, to truſt to, was contented to put his honeſty to ſaile: and being furnis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed with thoſe neceſſaryes, arriued vnder the towne walls, according to his directions. He was welcome to hungry men, for the prouiſion he brought: and the Gouernour, deſirous to know particulars, examined him about our Camp, about the paſſage he found into the towne, and what was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150642:76"/>the Generall opinion abroad of the ſtate of their affaires: The fellow, being ſubtil, and diſſembling as falſly as an other Sinon, related many trew things, and feyned as many, of his owne head, which begat a great belief, in them, of his honeſty and truſt: For men or euer apt to beleeue wath they deſire should be. In concluſion, being asked whether he durſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to carry any letters, by that paſſage, by which he eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the towne, shewing himſelf, at firſt, fearfull, and doubtfull what to anſwer, ſuffered them by promiſes to worke him to that, to which of all things, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of backwardneſſe, he deſired to be perſwaded. The Gouernour therfore truſted him with his letters to Count Maurice, promiſsing him great rewards, if he brought him an anſwer. The counterfaict promiſed to do his beſt; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned back againe into our Quarter, he brought the Gouernours letter to Spinola, to peruſe: The contents of it were theſe: <q>That he was much conforted with the receipt of three of Count Maurice his letters,<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Breda his letter to Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.</note> by which he vnderſtood of Mansfeilds ſafe arriuall with his English and Germaine forces, and of other preparations for the releife of Breda. That, for his part, he would take care, as he had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken before, that the Corne they had in the towne, should hould out till the end of Aprill or beginning of May, vnleſſe haply it chanced to be fired, by the enemyes often shooting of fire-balls into the Towne. That he would short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make an other ſearch of the Towneſmen corne. That Spinola had drawne away ſome peeces of Artillery, from his greateſt Battery (oppoſite to their water-mill) to Ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons Quarter, and planted them vppon the heath, towards Gertrudenberg, and that he began to fortify that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anew. That the garriſon of Breda was much leſned, by the plague, the fluxe and the ſcuruy, deſeaſes which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſorely emongſt them. That ſick perſons ſuffered much, for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:150642:76"/>want of Phiſick, and good food. That ſuch as had their health were nothing dishartned, but waited ſome good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make proofe of their valour. That their rape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oile was almoſt all conſumed in lamps, before they made any vſe of it in their meats, and that little or none of it, was now remayning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Spinola, hauing peruſed theſe letters, and ſealed them vp againe, gaue them back to the ſame meſſenger,<note place="margin">Spinola peruſed the letters, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them againe, and gaue them back to the Peſant.</note> promiſsing to reward him liberally, if he could bring him back the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Count Maurice and Mansfeild. Count Maurice, beleiuing he might confidently repoſe his truſt in one, who had ben ſo carefull in bringing him the Gouernours letters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned anſwer by this peſant, giuing him a larg reward, and ſent him to Count Mansfeild, to take his letters along with him.

That the States ships, which went to fetch them, were already arriued there, with a proſperous wind. That one part of the french foot forces was already arriued, with the duke of Candale, the reſt were vppon the way; and ſo was the reſt of the horſe and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:150642:77"/>foot raiſed in Germany for the States; That the other french, English and Germane ſupplies, would be ready againſt that tyme, till when he deſired him to hould out the Towne, that is, till end of Aprill.Mansfeild wrote to Gouernour,<note place="margin">Mansfeilds Jetter.</note> that he hoped short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be his gueſt, that then they would be merry togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and drinke his, and his reſolute fellow-ſouldiers healths; That he was arriued with a hundred foot Companyes, and forty troupes of horſe; that he should not doubt of being ſuccoured.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Spinola, being now againe aſſured of the ſmall prouiſion of the towne, and of the delayes of their ſupplies, thought it high tyme, vppon the <hi>30.</hi> of March, then Eaſter day, to taſt the Gouernour, about the ſurrendring of the towne. He ſent therfore ſecretly to him the Count Sallacars Trumpet, with letters of this tenure: <q>That hitherto he had not treated,<note place="margin">Spinoldes firſt leffer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But now, that he was aſſured of the day till when, precrſely, their corne would hould out, for which cauſe it were not wiſdome, for him, to deferre, any longer, the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the towne; he thought good, now, to offer him hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conditions, if he would be contented to begin to treat with him. And if, vppon the confidence he had of the ſuccours he expected, he should deſire, of him, any reaſonable ſet tyme, to hould out Towne, in expectation of thoſe ſuccours (which hopes yet he himſelfe might eaſily gheſſe to be vayne, when he should conſider the ſtrength of our workes, and greatnes of our Army) that he was contented to condeſcend to his deſire, and requeſt, prouided, that the treaty might begin, from that preſent; otherwiſe, he should not expect the like fauour hereafter,</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Gouernour, aſſembling preſently the Counſell of warre, read publykely to them theſe letters of Spinola, but,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:150642:77"/>being-confident of ſuccours, vppon the large promiſſes made him, and his prouiſion being now encreaſed, by the death of ſo many of the beſeiged, he returned this anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That he had peruſed Spinolaes letters,<note place="margin">The Couer nours anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola.</note> and admired the ſtrangeneſſe of his demaund; the rather, bycauſe he percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that Spinola beleeued him, and ſo many reſolute men as he had with him in the Towne, were to be dishart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſcarred wich words, who, he aſſured him, feared nothing, vnder heauen, but the loſſe of their reputation: That tyme would shew him his errour, how groſly he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the State of the towne, out of a ſelf-flattery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue it: That he was confident he should be forced to deliuer the towne to no man, but to them, who firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the defence of it to his charge.</q>

Houbeit it was commonly ſuſpected, that Spinola had ſent a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to the Gouernour to treat of a ſurrender, which only thing was enough to perſwade them, that their ſufferings drew now welneare towards the period: though ſome men feared the worſt, by the diſcourſes of others, and began to ſuſpect that Spinola had ben deceaued in his hopes, and, that the buiſnes would aske a longer tyme then was beleiued. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, for the preſent, the treaty was left to tyme, and, with the raiſing of ſtrong works, we expected the comming of ſo many forraine forces.</p>
            <p>Meane while the enemy drew all his forces to Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudenberg, and Spranghen, taking all his ſouldiers,<note place="margin">The enemy began now to draw all their forces to Gertru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deberg and Spranghe.</note> out of garriſon, and hiring Burgers in their places, exp ecting dayly the reſt of the Army, which wintred at Roſendale. But Spinola being iealious of thoſe long delayes of the enemy, and fearing, leaſt vnder colour of comming thither, they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150642:78"/>might chance to circumuent him, in ſome other place, rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced the garriſons of Rhenebergh,<note place="margin">Spinola re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforchet ſuch gairi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery to be attempted by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> Bolduc and VVeſel (pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces moſt likely to be attempted by the enemy, to diuert Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola from the Seige of Breda.) He put into Bolduc, beſides the ordinary garriſon, fiue hundred new men, raiſed by the Baron of Grobbendonck, Gouernour of that towne, to ſtrengthen the Regiment lately beſtowed vppon him. He cauſed ſeauen foot-Companies to march out of the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to VVeſel, with which Rhenbergh alſo, not far of, might be ſupplied: but he was afterwards aſſured, by the intercepting of ſome letters of Count Maurice to the Gouernour, that all thoſe troupes were intended for the releife of Breda, and that they were then lodged not far from our Campe.</p>
            <p>Theſe garriſons being now reinforced,<note place="margin">Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice found means to ſet on fire Gineken Cirurch were we had great prounion of Corne.</note> as hath ben ſaid, Gount Maurice found meanes, by his ſpies, to ſet on fire Gineken Church (where we had a prouiſion of ſix thouſand ſacks of meale) with a Granary of Oats adtoyning to the Church. The fire ſpread ſo ſuddainly with the wind, that it was not poſsible to quench it; yet notwithſtanding, two thouſand ſacks were found entire, the next day, which lay within theſe that were conſumed, and ſpoiled. Spinola, not being mooued more then reaſon requireth, for ſuch an accident (ſending preſently about, to all places, to buy more corne) in short tyme ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and made good that loſſe. Vppon the ſight of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, Vincent Laſannia Ouer-ſeer generall of the victualls, preſented him with three thouſand ſacks of wheat, which he had ſecretly prouided and concealed in the Campe, againſt any accident of fire, or other misfortune whatſoeuer.

And with theſe and like fables, inuented and exaggerated by the Hollanders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they published our wants, and fed their owne hopes.

            <p>Spinola, being warned by letters, of the like daunger, like to happen to his munition houſe (which the enemy had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to ſet on fire,<note place="margin">Spinola preuenteth the likemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife like to happen to his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</note> as they had lately done the Church) cauſed the guards of the munition houſe to be doubled, and drew an other ditch about it, with order that, from thence foreward, it should be more carefully garded: and leaſt, if ſuch an accident should peraduenture happen, his whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of powder should be blowne vp togeather, and his Army come to want, he tranſported welneare the half of his powder, into an other ſtore houſe, which, for that end, he cauſed to be built.</p>

            <p>About this tyme,<note place="margin">Newes of the death of the king of England.</note> newes was brought of the death of the King of England, a thing which cauſed a demurre in the proceedings of Mansfeild, and the States. Diuers English ſouldiers forſaking their colours, came dayly running to our Campe: our ſouldiers taken priſoners by any of Mansfeilds troupes, were returned home without ranſome, he making open profeſsion not to be in enmity with the King of Spaine. But Prince Henry of Naſſau,<note place="margin">The States ioyne all their forces</note> commanding the troupes of Roſendale to march towards him, and drawing out all his garriſon ſouldiers (as if the buiſnes were ſpeedily to come to a tryall) cauſed his new men to be exerciſed dayly, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to keepe his ſouldiers minds buiſied, that they might the leſſe thinke of running from their colours. Spinola, that he might haue all his forces and ſupplies in a readines, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Count Henry vanden Bergh at Hooghſtrat with his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,<note place="margin">Spinola draweth his forces to geather.</note> a thouſand horſe of the Duke of Saxony, and <hi>3000.</hi> foot of the Regiment of Count Collat (ſupplies ſent by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.) Spinola himſelf viſited the towne and Caſtle of Hoogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat, and cauſed it to be fortified, and from thence to the Campe, at a certayne diſtance, cauſed ſix forts to be rayſed vppon that riuer which runneth from Hooghſtrat. In the voyd ſpaces, betwixt theſe forts, he lodged diuers looſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150642:80"/>Companyes of ſouldiers, ſo thick that they almoſt met one with the other: that the Army, at any tyme, vppon the ſuddaine, might make head againſt the enemy, either at Breda, or at Hoogſtrate, as need should moſt require. He lodged Count Anholt, with his Germaine forces, to the number of three thouſand foot of his owne, and fiue and twenty hundred horſe, partly of his owne, and partly of the Regiments of Count Giacomo Strozzi, and of the Coronels Auendan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o, Gratz and Neers: and Don Carlos Coloma, and the Prince of Barbancon, with the Army raiſed by the Cuntry, in the Villages neare Anwerp Mechline and Lyre.

Our old ſouldiers, trayned vp ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in wayting oportunityes to offend the enemy, then hurt our owne men, who to that tyme had carried them ſelfues with as much temper, and moderation, as could be expected, taught now by the example of others (as ſouldiers commonly haue a naturall propenſion to do ill) betooke themſelues to the like diſorders, abuſing the name of others, for a colour of their owne inſolences. Spinola, giuing firſt their Commaunders warning of it, and iudging it mory neceſſary for him, at that

            <p>VVhilſt our forces were diſtributed vp and downe in theſe places, Maurice Prince of Orange, deſeaſed at the Hage,<note place="margin">Maurice Priné of Orangne deceaſed at the the Hage.</note> happy yet in this, thad he liued not to lament his loſſe of Breda.

            <p>The States made choiſe preſently of Prince Henry, Maurice his Brother, for their Generall, a Prince wel experienced in the warres, affable, and a great Courtier.<note place="margin">Diuers ſouldiers of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes Army as well as of ours, runne from their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</note> VVhilſt the States were buiſied with the funeralls of Count Maurice, and the election of their new Generall, diuers ſouldiers of our new Army, raiſed by the Cuntry, weary already of the warres, returned home againe; and others, of our old horſe-men, tired out with the continuall labour, and will payment of their wages, fled from the Campe. But Mansfeilds french ſouldiers ranne to vs euery day, in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter troupes, complaining they had ben deceaued, and made beleiue they should be led into the Palatinate, and that, in the ſpace of ſeauen monethes, they had receaued no pay at all.

            <p>The States new Generall Henry,<note place="margin">Henry Prince of Orange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to the Campe.</note> now Prince of Orange, returned, within few dayes, againe to their Campe, and they of Breda, glad of their ſuccour, which they beleiued to be at hand, let fly their Artellery more freely into our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. One Canon Ball,<note place="margin">Spinola eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeth two imminent daungers.</note> lighting vppon Spinolaes owne Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, at ſuch tyme as, by good fortune, he was abſent, carried away the Canopy of his bed, and broake in pieces two tables, in his Camber; an accident not vnlike that which hapned heretofore to the Emperour<note n="*" place="margin">Suetonius</note> Auguſtus, who being departed firſt out of his Tent, at the intreaty of ſome freinds, had his Tent preſently ranſaked, by the rushing in of ſome enemyes of his, and his Couch cut in pieces and perced, in many places, his enemyes beleiuing the Emperour himſelfe to haue ben there. VVithin foure dayes, or therabouts, after this accident, Spinola, riding vp and downe, vppon a white hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, deſirous to make ſome deſcouery, ſome what neare the Towne, an other Canon ball ſtrooke the bitt of his bridle, out of his horſes mouth, leauing the reynes of the bridle in his hand. So that it is probable, that, either Almighty God hath a peculiar care of great Generalls, or that, by how much the more a man aduentureth himſelf, ſo much the leſſe danger, for the moſt part, he incurreth. Spinola, hauing now eſcaped theſe dangers, cauſed his ſupplies, which he had at hand,<note place="margin">Spinela draweth his forces to a head.</note> to march nearer to him, and lodged them, in ſeuerall places, behind the inner and outward trench. Count Anholt, in the reare of Balancons Quarter, towards the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:150642:81"/>heath of Ooſterhout, in which place it was ſuſpected Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild would breake in; The Baron of Beauoix, oppoſite to the Village of Mede (Count Maurice his old Quarter) with that Regiment of Count Iohn Naſſawes, which was paid by the Emperour; Count Iohn Naſſaw himſelf, with his other Regiment of the low Cuntryes, towards the heath of Chaem; The Baron d'Ainſy, who commanded the free Germane Companies, out of Regiments, with the title of a Coronell, in the reare of Gineken Quarter, where alſo he was to defend the Quarter of the Horſe; And diuers other troupes in diuers places about the Campe. He cauſed the horſe gards to be doubled, who marched, euery day, from their owne Quarter, to their ſeuerall gards. He viſited the Rounds, oftentymes, him ſelf, eſpecially in thoſe places, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he ſuſpected the enemy might breake in, neuer omitting it, any night, till the enemy retired.</p>
            <p>The worth of this man neuer shewed it ſelf more then now.<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of Spinola.</note> His continuall watching, or broaken ſleepe, neuer made him diſcurteous to any man. VVhen he awaked, out of his ſleepe, he looked as liuely, and was againe as ready for any new buiſnes, as if he had not before falne a ſleepe at all; ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping againe with as great eaſe, as if he had not ben waked, or broaken out of his ſleepe: for, hauing firſt taken order for all buiſneſſes, he ſlept out of feare. He contemned brauery in his apparell, being careleſſe of his outſide, yet ſo, that he euer maintayned the dignity of a great Generall. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to him, whether the weather were faire or foule, neuer regarding either rayne, ſnow, froſt, or winds, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were late in the euening, or darke night. He faſted diuers, tymes two dayes togeather. His bed, for the moſt part, was ſome Cart or ſouldiers Cabin. He was neither cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of his diet, reſt, or any thing about himſelf. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of all weighty affaires lay wholy vppon him, in which he laboured, and tooke paynes beyond beleife. His courage
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:150642:82"/>was inuincible; his countenance euer the ſame, what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſoeuer hapned, by which he preſerued and fed his ſouldiers hopes. He guided not himſelfe, according to his owne opinion only, nor opened his buiſnes to any, but ſuch as he had need of, doing nothing rashly, but diſgeſting all buiſneſſes, with deliberation. His ſecrets were buried in ſilence. He did not eaſily credit any newes, vppon the ſuddaine, but was as hard of beleife, in ſuch occaſions, as he was apt to contemne any doubtfull report, that might deiect him, knowing the ſtrength of wisdome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; in not being ouer credulous. To foreſee, conſult, write, giue audience, take order for buiſneſſes, often viſit and ride about his Campe, were paſtimes to him. He neuer retired him ſelf for any wearines, nor denied any man acceſſe to him. He was curteous to his ſouldiers, to the Peſants, and to his ſpies, as far as ſtood with the honour of a great Commaunder, making vſe of ſpies only for neceſsity. He bore more outward reſpect to ſuch as ſtood ill affected to him, whoſe power was able to change the face of buiſneſſes, then to his boſome-freinds; houbeit, in him ſelfe, he feared no mans hatred.</p>
            <p>In the Village of Hage, three ſpies were taken, going to the Towne,<note place="margin">Three ſpies apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> with a great packet of letters, a good quantity of Tabacco, and ſome Bottles of oile, to cure the deſeaſe, called the Scuruy. At the inſtant they were apprehended, they found meanes, in the woods therabouts, to hide the Prince of Orange his letter to the Gouernour. But one of them, who had often tymes before paſſed, through our Gampe, to the Towne, by means of the careleſneſſe of ſome of our Gentinels, being put to the torture, confeſſed the letters, and place where he had hidden them. The Prince of Orange his letter to the Gouernour, was this:</p>
            <p>
               <q>That his Brother Maurice was deceaſed,<note place="margin">The Prince of Orange his letter to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> and the States had made choiſe of him, for their Generall, in his place.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150642:82"/>That, that ſad accident should be no hindrance to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours they expected. That, within three dayes, he would be with his Army, in the Village of Dunghen, two lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues diſtant from Breda, where they of the Towne might diſcouer him, from the top of their higheſt ſteeple. That it was not poſsible the Army could haue ben ſooner in a readines, but that now he would leaue no means vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to releiue them. That the Gouernour should haue a care, by husbanding, or leſning the diſtribution of Corne, to make it hould out; and to encourage the ſouldiers, by repreſenting to them the reſolution of ſo ſelect an Army of the States, with the incredible expences, and deſire they had to releiue them. That he should write back to him, in what place, how, and by what meanes, he might beſt breake into Spinolaes Quarter; and, for the more facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of that enterpriſe, that he, in like manner, should concurre, and fall on with his forces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They of Breda, who by ſome other conueyance, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued an other of theſe letters, were much comforted, and much afflicted, with the ſeuerall tydings it brought them. They lamented the loſſe of ſo able a Generall as Count Maurice, and yet they were comforted againe with the ioyfull newes of their ſuccours. From the top of their Church-ſteeple is a large proſpect into the Cuntry, from thence they diſcouered their Army, congratulating, and comforting one an other with that ſight. They ſounded a horne, from the top of the ſteeple, as if we were already running away. They called out to vs, from their VValls, to pack vp bag and baggage,<note place="margin">vaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</note> forgetfull that they, and their Breda was the prey hunted after, and wee, not they, the huntſmen of is Deere.

Fiue of the Burgundian ſouldiers were ſlayne, in the defence; ſeauen of them were ſorely ſcorched with the fire. Of the enemy, bycauſe their numbers were great, many more were ſlayne and hurt, with ſtones which our men threw downe thick vppon them, for, being fearefull of the fire, they wiſely threw downe, from the top of the ſteeple all the powder they had.

But many things at that tyme put vs in great hopes: Mansfeilds french forces ranne away apace; the enemy was ſlow in bringing his ſupplies; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the Towne began much to faile; the beſeiged were ſorely afflicted with ſicknes; all Phiſick was ſo deare, that, as much Tabacco, as in other places might haue ben had for foure<note n="*" place="margin">Twenty shillings</note> Crownes, was ſould in Breda for<note n="*" place="margin">a hundred and twenty pound ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> twelue hundred flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, Tabacco being the only remedy they had againſt the ſcuruy. And, in the ſpace of eight dayes, our men had taken aboue ſix hundred of the enemyes horſe, being careleſly put to graſſe neare about their Campe.

Our boats and wagons were in readines for them, againſt that day, and our ſouldiers tooke the garde of the three Ports of the Towne, and Caſtle. Count Herman vanden Bergh, with fiue troupes of Horſe, marched before, conuoying them to Gertrudenbergh, and betwixt euery tenth wagon, ſome horſe men of ours were placed, to garde their baggage. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Bergagnes horſe-troupe marched in the van of them,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150642:102"/>and an other troupe of their horſe brought vp the Reare, in both which troupes there were but few horſes, ſo much they were both impaired by this Seige.

Each Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell marched in the van of their owne Regiments, and the Captaines, at the head of their Companies. They marched with Colours flying, and drummes beating.
